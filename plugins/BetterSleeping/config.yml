# Choose whether or not BetterSleeping should check for updates on startup
# No information from your server is shared or collected in this process.
# Default: true
update_checker: true


# --------------- #
# Sleep settings  |
# --------------- #


# Set the percentage of online players that need to be sleeping to skip the night/storm
# The number of players will be rounded up!
# Example: 2 online players + this is set to 51 => 51% * 2 = 1,02 but it will be rounded up so: 2 players needed!
# Default: 30
percentage_needed: 30


# Set the time (in ticks) that players will have to remain in their beds when enough people are sleeping
# A delay of one second is equal to 20 ticks so setting this to 40 means a delay of two seconds (which roughly equals the single player delay)
# Default: 40
sleep_delay: 40


# Set the time (in seconds) that players have to wait before they can enter a bed again after getting out of bed
# This prevents a player's ability to spam the other players
# Default: 10
bed_enter_delay: 10


# Choose whether or not AFK players (Essentials is required) will be counted towards the amount of sleeping players needed
# AFK time is not taken into account. Players may abuse this by setting themselves afk to lower the amount of required sleeping players
# Default: true
essentials_afk_support: true


# This is an EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE! Its behavior might be unexpected so please give me feedback
# Choose whether /bs night is enabled by default (only OP has access by default)
# /bs night or /bs n will disable skipping the night for a short time (which you can choose)
# This allows players with the correct permission to finish their business
# CAUTION! This feature can allow players to abuse this system and prevent the night from being skipped indefinitely!
# This setting will have no effect if all players in a world go to bed. Nothing can be done about that as it is a default mechanic
# Default: false
enable_no_skip_night_command: false
# Choose for how many minutes the night won't be skipped after executing /bs night
# Default: 1 (in minutes!)
disable_skip_time: 1


# --------------- #
# Bypass settings |
# --------------- #


# !!!PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING!!!
# Due to popular demand, bypass permissions can now be disabled. There is a catch, however.
# An issue may arise when this is set to false and Essentials is installed:
# When everyone (except for OPs) is sleeping, the night is skipped instantly and BetterSleeping will send a message saying that skipping the night was canceled!
# If set to true, BetterSleeping will ignore those players and this bug can no longer occur.
# If you want to prevent this bug AND allow OPs to sleep, please do the following:
# Add both permissions (below) to all OPs, using a permissions plugin like PermissionsEx, LuckPerms, GroupManager, etc.
# Negate bettersleeping.bypass AND essentials.sleepingignored
#   With permissionsEx, negating is done by adding a '-' in front of the permission
#   With LuckPerms, negating is done by setting the permission node to false
#   Other permission management plugins may have a different syntax, please check their information
# Gamemodes can still be ignored if this is set to false.
# Now that you know all the details, you can safely make the right decision.
# Default: true
enable_bypass_permissions: true


# Decide whether or not players with sleeping bypass permissions will get buffs
# Those players will not be able sleep, even if they want to. This means that they would never get their buffs if this is set to false.
# Default: true
buffs_for_bypassing_players: true


# Choose whether or not vanished players should be bypassed
# The plugins on the line below are supported
# Essentials, Essentials-compatible vanish plugins, PremiumVanish, SuperVanish, VanishNoPacket and even more plugins!
# Without a supported plugin, this setting will have no effect
# Default: true
ignore_vanished_players: true


# Here you can choose whether or not you want BetterSleeping to ignore players with each gamemode
# Default: false (for all options)
ignore_survival: false
ignore_creative: false
ignore_adventure: false


# Choose whether or not phantoms are disabled
# Setting this to true means that phantoms will never spawn again (this effects ALL phantoms)
# Phantoms that spawned before setting this to true will still live until despawned or killed
# Please do not set this to true if you are using a Spigot version below 1.13 as this can cause errors in the console
# Default: false
disable_phantoms: false


# ----------------- #
# Messages settings |
# ----------------- #


# Choose whether or not a sound will be played when a player receives a BetterSleeping message
# Default: false
message_sound: false


# This is an EXPERIMENTAL feature!
# Choose whether or not non-sleeping players should receive the following BetterSleeping messages (see lang.yml)
# When an option is set to true, that message will only be sent to players that are sleeping.
# Default: false (for all options)
enough_sleeping_sleepingOnly: false
good_morning_sleepingOnly: false
cancelled_sleepingOnly: false
amount_left_sleepingOnly: false


# Choose where the messages will appear
# Setting this to true will result in the messages being sent to the chat
# Setting this to false will result in the messages being shown on screen
# !IMPORTANT! (only when set to false)
# Sometimes several messages are sent at once. Only the last message will be shown on screen!
# Please disable the messages below in lang.yml or people may never receive 'good_morning'
#   - buff_received: "ignored"
#   - no_buff_received: "ignored"
# If you really want to say good morning AND list the amount of buffs received:
#   - Disable 'good_morning' and add your good morning to the two messages listed above.
# A faulty configuration will be reported to the console upon startup or reload and will tell you what to change
# Default: true
messages_in_chat: true
