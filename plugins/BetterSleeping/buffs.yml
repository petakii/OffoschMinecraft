# These are effects that will be applied after sleeping, only on the players that have slept
# The idea is to give a well rested bonus so sleeping is encouraged and more people will try to sleep
# Players with a sleeping bypass permission (bettersleeping.bypass or essentials.sleepingignored) will also get the buffs but never need to sleep


# CONFIGURATION GUIDE:
# To disable an effect, set its time to 0 or simply remove it from the list
# Not all in-game effects are included so adding options outside of the list below is not supported:
# regeneration, absorption, jump, speed, damage_resistance, fast_digging, increase_damage
# Feel free to request more effects
# Time
# The time in ticks for which the effect will be applied
# 20 ticks generally equals one second.
# Level
# The level doesn't have to be a vanilla level. OP configurations are possible.
# Setting it too high may have unexpected results (<90 should be fine)
